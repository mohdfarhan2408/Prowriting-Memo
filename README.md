# Problem
UX writing has a direct impact on the user experience. Good UX writing will increase product usability, get more customers, and increase conversion. However, the team spends >200 hours and uses >5 tools to generate quality UX Writing. The whole process can take 3 full days for proofreading, 7 days for localization, and another 7–14 days for QA. The larger the company, the more products are developed, the more time is needed, and the harder it is to manage. 

For a product with multiple languages, it’s very tough for them to ensure that all the languages are aligned with the branding that they have. Currently, the company uses a translation tool or hires a translator that will cost them at least $3K-$4K per head per month. In the case of rebranding or iterating, they need to inform and update them manually for every language, this process is very inefficient and tiresome.

Those aren’t the only issues they have; another problem is the lack of consistency between the product design and marketing teams. It often happens that the marketing team uses different terms and tone compared to the product design team or vice versa, which confuses the users and adds barriers to product adoption.

# Solution
Prowriting offers software that helps the UX and Marketing teams generate content that is clear, concise, and consistent with the brand guidelines on a single platform much faster. 

How it works: Simply provide basic information about the company, product, or brand. This includes location, language, and industry. Prowriting's proprietary technology, which is also powered by AI language models, will learn from that information, writing style, and tone in generating  contents for marketing or ux writing. Users can also customize the tone and writing style to be similar to AirBnB, Apple or any other known brand. Because everything is done in a single platform, it ensures consistency across the teams, and, most importantly, aligns with the brand guidelines. 

UX Writing: Prowriting offers a plugin with Figma that simplifies the UX writing process for the Product Design team. For example, it’ll detect which pages you're writing for (eg: homepage, checkout, or payment) and suggest the correct tone of voice based on the collected data. Users can also do the proofreading instantly in Figma to eliminate any typos and grammatical errors. With this, users don’t need to do it in separate tools like Grammarly or Writer which may use different terms and be inconsistent with their brand guidelines. 

Marketing: Team members can simply generate marketing content for any function, including email marketing, social media advertising, etc. 

Localization: Prowriting is currently available in English and Bahasa, but it’ll come with more languages in the future. This feature, however, needs time to fully develop, especially in terms of the accuracy and consistency of the translation. If they can execute it, it’ll give them a clear competitive advantage and make it tough for anyone to copy it.

Backend: Beside leveraging AI language models, Prowriting implemented multiple prompt layers and UX-specific parameters to ensure the end results have a clearer meaning and are more concise. It’s like having many layers of instruction and guidelines that produce more consistent, unique, and quality output.
